<title>Using Spring Data JPA To Reduced Data Repository Coding</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>On March 24, 2011, springsource released milestone 2 of the Spring Data JPA library.  Per the 
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data" target="_blank">Spring Data project website</a>,
Spring Data JPA:</p>

<blockquote>
Simplifies the development of creating a JPA-based data access layer and provides 'cross-store' persistence functionality for JPA managed entites [sic].
</blockquote>

<p>Since I recently started using JPA 2 in my Spring applications, I decided to learn more about Spring Data JPA.
To assist my learning, I took an 
<a href="http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2010/12/28/Recommended-Way-To-Structure-A-Spring-3-JPA-2-and-Maven-Web-Application" 
target="_blank">example project</a> that uses Struts 2, Spring 3, JPA 2 (with Hibernate 3.5 as the JPA 
provider) and modified it to use Spring Data JPA.  This blog article is about what I had to modify so the 
project could use Spring Data JPA and what I could then get rid of.</p>

<h3>Example Application That Uses Spring Data JPA</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.brucephillips.name/spring/strutsspringdataexample.zip">Download the example application</a> that 
uses Spring Data JPA. It is a standard Maven project, created using Eclipse 3.6. The application uses an in-memory database 
(HSQL) that is setup by the Spring applicationContext.xml class. See files schema.sql and test-data.sql in src/main/resources 
for the schema created during the application's startup and the initial records inserted into the table's database. 
Using the in-memory database means there is no need to setup and run a separate database server for the example application.

<p>You can import this project into Eclipse by using Eclipse's File - Import feature. In the project's root folder is a 
README.txt file that explains how to run the application. 
If you're not using Eclipse with the Maven plugin, you can unzip the archived download and 
view the source code in any text editor. If you are using a Java IDE that enables importing of Maven projects you should be able to import the unzipped project.</p>

<p>You can also run the application using Maven directly if you have downloaded and installed Maven on your computer. 
Open a terminal (command) window and navigate to the project's root folder (the folder where pom.xml resides). 
Then in the terminal window issue these commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>mvn clean</li>
<li>mvn test (All tests should pass successfully)</li>
<li>mvn jetty:run</li>
</ol>

<p>When you see [INFO] Started Jetty Server open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/strutsspringdataexample/index.jsp. 
Enter 1, 2, or 3 in the employee id text field and click submit.</p>

<p>To stop the Jetty web server type CTRL-C in the terminal window.</p>

<h3>How To Enable Spring Data JPA In Your Project</h3>

<p>To use the Spring Data JPA library I had to add the Spring milestone repository to the project's pom.xml file.</p>

<code>

		<repository>
			<id>org.springframework.maven.milestone</id>
			<name>Spring Maven Milestone Repository</name>
			<url>http://maven.springframework.org/milestone</url>
		</repository>

</code>

<p>I also added the dependency node for the Spring Data JPA artifact.  Note the version current as of 
March 25, 2011 is 1.0.0.M2 but that will change as the project moves forward. Consult the 
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data" target="_blank">Spring Data project website</a>
for the current version.</p>

<code>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-data-jpa</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0.M2</version>
		</dependency>

</code>

<p>To use the Spring Data JPA's namespace in my Spring configuration file I added this namespace
declaration and schema location:</p>

<code>

  xmlns:jpa="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/jpa"
  
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/jpa 
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/jpa/spring-jpa.xsd

</code>

<p>To enable Spring to find the Repository bean (more on this in a moment) I also added this 
node to the Spring configuration file:</p>

<code>

&lt;jpa:repositories base-package="name.brucephillips.springjpaexample.repository" /&gt;	

</code>

<p>The above tells Spring to look in package name.brucephillips.springjpaexample.repository for 
any interfaces annotated with the @Repository annotation or an interface that extends one of 
the Spring Data JPA interfaces.</p>

<h3>How To Use Spring Data JPA To Reduce Data Repository Code</h3>

<p>If you examine the source code for the previous <a href="http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2010/12/28/Recommended-Way-To-Structure-A-Spring-3-JPA-2-and-Maven-Web-Application" 
target="_blank">example project</a> that did not use Spring Data JPA, you'll find that I defined a dao package with an interface and implementation class to enable 
interaction between Person objects and the data repository.  The PersonDaoJpa class uses the JPA EntityManager to perform the basic CRUD tasks and to also find a 
specific Person object using the Person class's emplid instance field.</p>

<p>To convert that project to use Spring Data JPA, I deleted the dao package, the interface, and the implementation class.  Those are no longer needed when using 
Spring Data JPA.  In the example application that does use Spring Data JPA, you'll find a repository package, with one interface:</p>

<code>

public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Person, Long&gt; {
	
	/**
	 * Get Person with the associated emplid.
	 * @param emplid - Employee ID
	 * @return Person object if provided emplid is 
	 * found in the data repository, otherwise return null
	 */
	Person findByEmplid(Long emplid);

}

</code>

<p>Note that the PersonRepository interface extends <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/1.0.0.M2/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html" 
target="_blank"> interface JpaRepository</a>, which is provided by the Spring Data JPA library. The JpaRepository interface specifies all the standard CRUD methods my project 
may need to use to manage Person objects with the data repository. Also note the use of &lt;Person, Long&gt;.  This tells Spring that this repository is for class 
Person and that class Person's field annotated with @ID is type Long.</p>

<p>What I did not need to code is an implementation of the PersonRepository interface. Spring will create an implementation of this interface and make a PersonRepository bean 
available to be autowired into my Service class.  The PersonRepository bean will have all the standard CRUD methods (which will be transactional) and 
return Person objects or collection of 
Person objects.  So by using Spring Data JPA, I've saved writing my own implementation class.</p> 

<p>The only code I needed to write in interface PersonRepository was for method declarations for any non-standard CRUD methods I want to use.  
In this example, I want to find a Person by using
his emplid value.  Note that emplid is defined as an instance field in class Person.  How I named this method is important.   Spring Data JPA will translate
the method name into a JPA criteria query.  See the 
<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/1.0.0.M2/reference/html/" target = "_blank">Spring Data JPA documentation</a>
 for more information about how Spring Data JPA translates method names into 
queries.  Spring Data JPA does allow you to override its query translation from method name and specify your own query.</p>

<h3>Modify The Service Class To Use The Spring Created Repository Bean</h3>

<p>In my Service class (see PersonServiceImpl) I just needed to add an instance field for the JPA EntityManager and a field 
for the PersonRepository object.  Both of these will automatically be provided to the class by Spring because of the 
@PersistenceContext and @Autowired annotations.</p>

<code>

@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager em;
	
@Autowired
private PersonRepository personRepository;
	

</code>

<p>Then I just replaced using the personDao object with using the personRepository object in the PersonServiceImpl class.</p>

<p>All my JUnit tests passed and the application runs fine.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Spring Data JPA seems very useful in reducing the amount of data repository code you'll need to write.  If you're already using Spring 3 
and JPA 2 then adding Spring Data JPA may be a good idea and should save development time.</p>
<p>There is more Spring Data JPA can do including built-in support 
for paging and sorting objects returned.  Consult the references below for additional information. </p>
