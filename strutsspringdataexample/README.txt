strutsspringdataexample project

Introduction

This project is an example of how to use Struts 2, Spring 3, Spring Data JPA 1.0, JPA 2 
(with Hibernate 3.5 as the JPA provider) and Maven to configure a
web application.  Spring release milestone 2 of its Spring Data JPA artifacts.

To run the tests and application you will need Maven installed on your computer.

To create the JavaDoc run mvn javadoc:javadoc.  To view the JavaDoc refresh the 
target folder and navigate to target/site/apidocs and open index.html in a web browser.

Project Configuration


The application uses the configuration described in section 13.5 of the Spring 3.0 documentation
(http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/orm.html#orm-jpa)
to setup Spring integration with JPA.  

The application also uses the Spring Data JPA library to have Spring automatically 
create a PersonRepository bean to manage interaction between Person objects and the 
data repository.  The PersonRepository bean Spring creates is based 
on the PersonRepository interface in the repository package.
See - http://www.springsource.org/spring-data for more information about Spring Data JPA.

The JPA persistence.xml file is found in src/test/resources/META-INF for testing and for the 
deployed webapp the persistence.xml file is in src/main/webapp/META-INF.  

The Spring configuration file for the tests--applicationContextTest.xml--is found in 
src/test/resources.  The Spring configuration file for the web application is found 
in src/main/resources.

The Spring configuration file creates a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean object 
and provides it with the data source, location of the persistence.xml file, and the 
name of the persistence unit to use.


The persistence.xml file defines the persistence unit including what classes are to be
JPA entities, what is the JPA provider (Hibernate), and the properties for the JPA 
provider.

The model classes use JPA 2 annotations to identify how a model class is related to a 
database table.

The service class uses Spring's @Service annotation to mark the class as one Spring should
automatically create an instance of in the Inversion of Control container.  Using the Struts 2 
Spring plugin (see the pom.xml) will cause Spring to inject the services classes into the 
Struts 2 Action Support classes.

The service class     
also uses the JPA @PersistenceContext annotation to mark which 
instance field Spring should use to inject the EntityManager object.  
The PersonRepository bean that Spring creates will use that EntityManager object.   

In the service class the PersonRepository that is needed is annotated with Spring's @Autowired annotation.
  

Testing, Building, and Running The Application Using Maven
 
After downloading the zipped project archive, unzip it.  Navigate to the 
project's root folder - root folder is named strutsspringdataexample (the pom.xml file 
should be in this folder).

To run the tests use mvn -e clean test.

To run the application on the Jetty Servlet container use mvn -e jetty:run

Once you see [INFO] Started Jetty Server in the console output, open a web browser and navigate to:

     http://localhost:8080/strutsspringdataexample/index.jsp
     
Enter 1, 2, or 3 in the employee ID text box.

To stop the Jetty Servlet container type control-c in the terminal.
